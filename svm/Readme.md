## Steps to execute Support Vector Machines
1. python svm_author_id.py 

## Ouput1(C=1000,kernel=linear)
no. of Chris training emails: 7936

no. of Sara training emails: 7884

Training Time =  136.697 s

Test Time =  13.276 s

Accuracy =  0.994880546075

## Output2 - After adding lines to decrease the time (C= 1000,kernel=linear)
no. of Chris training emails: 7936

no. of Sara training emails: 7884

Training Time =  0.336 s

Test Time =  1.288 s

Accuracy =  0.8606370876

## Output3 (C=1,kernel=linear)
no. of Chris training emails: 7936

no. of Sara training emails: 7884
 
Training Time =  0.181 s

Test Time =  1.97 s

Accuracy =  0.884527872582

## Output4 (C=1 , kernel=rbf)
no. of Chris training emails: 7936

no. of Sara training emails: 7884

Training Time =  0.165 s

Test Time =  1.912 s

Accuracy =  0.616040955631

_**-- Greater the value of C , better the accuracy**_
